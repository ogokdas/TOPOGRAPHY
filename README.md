# TOPOGRAPHY
Project Name: Istanbul Water Management System

Demo of the program: https://youtu.be/A0va-vRevRM

Description:

I have developed the Istanbul Water Management System, a Python-based calculation tool, to assist me in calculating the water levels and volumes of the dams in Istanbul, as a member of the Istanbul Water and Sewerage Administration (ISKI). As the water levels in the dams are decreasing daily, it is crucial to accurately determine the new water volumes based on the dip topography points. My program offers a faster alternative to CAD programs and provides convenient scatter plots and volume bar charts for each level, allowing me to make comments and observations. It also saves the results for each level in a text file for future reference.

How it works:

My program utilizes a proprietary algorithm based on dip topography points to calculate the area and volume of each water level. I have incorporated the Tkinter module for user-friendly selection screens, the Numpy module for efficient calculations, and the Matplotlib module for creating visual representations.

Usage:

The Istanbul Water Management System is specifically designed for use by the Istanbul Water and Sewerage Administration (ISKI) to accurately calculate the water levels and volumes of the city's dams. This tool is intended for professionals with a background in water management and engineering.

Installation:

To use the Istanbul Water Management System, please ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your system. Additionally, the following modules are required: Tkinter, Numpy, and Matplotlib. Once these dependencies are installed, you can clone the repository and run the program effortlessly.
